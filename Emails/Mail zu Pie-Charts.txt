Hi all, 

I would like to insert a colored pie chart into my master's thesis I write with LaTeX using the KOMA-class sccreprt.

The purpose is to show the market share of different companies. This as a disclaimer, since I have read several times on the web, that it is advised against using pie charts. Still I find this the most illustrative way to depict the idea of market shares. I am totally happy to hear of any suggestions of other solutions that are superior to pie charts.

I came across several solutions, although most require the package pgf-pie to be installed, which apparently does not come with my TeX-Live 2013 (LaTeX, LuaTeX, XeLaTeX) on my Linux. As I mentioned in previous post, due to rather uncomfortable time constraints, I would like to tinker as few a possible with my TeX-installation. 

The first example works (http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/pie-chart/), but I'm totally at a loss about how get colors into the pie chart. This basically does the trick, I do not aspire to fancy stuff like a drawn out slice, but colors I definitively would like to see.


\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{calc}
\usepackage{ifthen}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\newcommand{\slice}[4]{
  \pgfmathparse{0.5*#1+0.5*#2}
  \let\midangle\pgfmathresult

  % slice
  \draw[thick,fill=black!10] (0,0) -- (#1:1) arc (#1:#2:1) -- cycle;

  % outer label
  \node[label=\midangle:#4] at (\midangle:1) {};

  % inner label
  \pgfmathparse{min((#2-#1-10)/110*(-0.3),0)}
  \let\temp\pgfmathresult
  \pgfmathparse{max(\temp,-0.5) + 0.8}
  \let\innerpos\pgfmathresult
  \node at (\midangle:\innerpos) {#3};
}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]

\newcounter{a}
\newcounter{b}
\foreach \p/\t in {20/type A, 4/type B, 11/type C,
                   49/type D, 16/other}
  {
    \setcounter{a}{\value{b}}
    \addtocounter{b}{\p}
    \slice{\thea/100*360}
          {\theb/100*360}
          {\p\%}{\t}
  }

\end{tikzpicture}

\end{document}

I should mention that in my case the pie chart is supposed to show that the markets is carved up by two companies, one having a 69 % market share, the other 29 %, which leaves 2 % for various other tiny firms. I'm not sure whether I could modify the example above quite easily to fit my needs, so any help here would also be higly appreciated.


Thanks in advance for you kind help, 

Pascal
